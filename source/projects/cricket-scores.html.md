title: Cricket Scores
---

I created [Cricket Scores](http://cricket-scores.herokuapp.com/) out of a desire to have a simple, responsive & quick way to check the latest scores of an ongoing cricket match, and to focus only on what was important to Australian fans.

<div class="tablet"><iframe src="//cricket-scores.herokuapp.com" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

When the existing media providers (at least on the web) didn't satisfy that requirement, I wanted to investigate ways to better display the vital match statistics.
