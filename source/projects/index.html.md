Some projects I've lead/been involved with at NetEngine include include [Big Sky](/projects/bigsky) and [Terrain](/projects/terrain).

I've been involved with [RHoK Brisbane](http://rhokbrisbane.org) since its inception, and have helped co-ordinate, design and build projects with [QLD Kids](http://concierge.org.au/) and [Karuna](http://karuna.rhokbrisbane.org/).

In my spare time recently I've been experimenting with building simple, beautiful data-driven apps such as [Cricket Scores](http://cricket-scores.herokuapp.com/) and [QLD Nature Data](http://nature-qld.herokuapp.com/).
