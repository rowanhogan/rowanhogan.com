## Hi, my name is Rowan Hogan, and I'm from Brisbane, Australia.

I'm a designer by nature, but slowly becoming a full-stack developer by necessity.

I currently work at [NetEngine](http://netengine.com.au). Some projects I've lead/been involved with include include [Big Sky](https://bigsky.io) and [Trigger](https://triggerapp.com).

I've been involved with RHoK Brisbane since its inception, and have helped co-ordinate, design and build projects with [QLD Kids](http://concierge.org.au/) and [Karuna](http://karuna.rhokbrisbane.org/).

In my spare time recently I've been toying with building simple, beautiful data-driven apps such as [this](http://cricket-scores.herokuapp.com/) and [this](http://nature-qld.herokuapp.com/).
