I first collaborated with photographer [Shantanu Starick](http://shantanustarick.com/) on a project to display his travel locations visited during his [Pixel Trade](http://thepixeltrade.com) project. The resulting [map](http://thepixeltrade.com/map) was a integration with [Big Sky](https://bigsky.io) and his Squarespace site.

We stayed in touch, and in 2015 Shantanu came to me with the idea to try an experiment pairing ambient recorded audio with photo galleries.

I always enjoy a challenge, and I had recently built an integration with the Soundcloud API for a project concept for [RHoK Brisbane](http://rhokbrisbane.org/). We went back and forth with a few quick iterations, and the resulting experiment came together.
